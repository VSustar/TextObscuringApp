# Text Obscuring App
 <br><br>
 The motive for the Text Obscuring App is for learning languages on intermediate level to improve the exact spelling of words. 
 Sufficient knowledge of language is expected to already comprehend the context and improve the fine spelling skills.
 The difficulty can somehow be adjusted by text selection and proportions of text/letters to be obscured.
